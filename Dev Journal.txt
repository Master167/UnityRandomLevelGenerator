I read on Gamesutra that aspiring game developers need to develop a portfolio of games. So, I started with this game. But I also read that employers are curious about the process that you used and how you overcame problems during development. Since I'm updating Visual Studio which means development with Unity has stopped, I'll start this journal. What I'll do for myself is put this into the following format. Date, Summary, accomplished last goal, next goal.

Summary:
This git repository is for a 2D level generator built in Unity3D that create a path for a platform character to run through. The idea has come from several rogue-likes that I've played over the last couple of years like Splunkey, Crypt of the Necrodancer, 20XX, and Rogue Legacy. The levels would be generated from a series of designed rooms with each room having a set of doors to align with each other. The idea behind that is to make a room for the character to go through with some enemies to fight or platforming challenges. My goal is to develop this level generator to be solid enough that I can create any room and the player would a path through to the end by lining up the doors to each room.

Right now, I don't have anything in my rooms since I don't have a character to move, actions for the character, or enemies to go against. This means that I could design challenges, but I wouldn't be able to play test them to make sure players could overcome those obstacles. Designing the player character will be the next item on my list once I have a level generation that fits my desires.

At first, I was just using a simple square room with four walls and door on each to create a path. I started creating rooms that were more rectangular without a problem. So, I decided to create a room more abstract with a stair case for the floor. This showed me a few problems with my current generation method. The first being that the placement of the room wasn't always correct if the door wasn't in the middle of adjacent wall. The other being that too much randomness was in the Level Generator and not in the rooms themselves. This means that I wouldn't be able to design a room that was meant to be run through left to right that the Level Generator would respect.

Accomplished last goal:
Considering I didn't make one. No.

Next Goal:
More path determination from the Level Generator to the rooms. I'll need to figure out a way to tell the Level Generator which direction the next room is open to from the current room.

Summary:
So, I started moving the direction decision making into the room script. I gave the room a set of boolean variables that I can manipulate in the Editor for each room that I create. Then I created a new method that takes the incoming direction and returns the outgoing direction. I also changed the HasDirection() from checking for a reference to checking a boolean. This will give the LevelGeneration script the ability to choose the room based on the room's design.

Accomplished last goal?:
Not quite, due to an event I forgotten about I had to cut dev time today short. But I got started!

Next Goal:
Re-work Level Generation script to use new methods

Summary:
I continued what I working out last time. I had to re-work my prefab rooms to use the new variables and they seems to be working. I also had to make some project changes to get Visual studio to be able to debug the unity scripts. I got the room generation loop to generate rooms in some path only opening the doors I need for whatever path the rooms are deciding to take the player though. So that progress.

The room translations were still messed up. I tried my hand at it again. This time taking each direction on it's own. I think when I wrote it earlier I tried to optimize it too soon and it wasn't maintainable. The new approach is to create a vector that will place the new room on top of the previous room. Then create a vector that would line up the two doors. Finally, adding the two vectors to be the vector that I use to translate the room.

At this time, no direction is working.

Accomplished last goal?:
Yes.

Next Goal:
Get the translation working for any numbers of right directions with any room that I have that goes from left to right.
