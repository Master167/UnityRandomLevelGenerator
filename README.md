UnityRandomLevelGenerator

This git repository is for a 2D level generator built in Unity3D that create a path for a platform character to run through. The idea has come from several rogue-likes that I've played over the last couple of years like Splunkey, Crypt of the Necrodancer, 20XX, and Rogue Legacy. The levels would be generated from a series of designed rooms with each room having a set of doors to align with each other. The idea behind that is to make a room for the character to go through with some enemies to fight or platforming challenges. My goal is to develop this level generator to be solid enough that I can create any room and the player would a path through to the end by lining up the doors to each room.
